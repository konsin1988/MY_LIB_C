/* Command for linux terminal of bash shell. 
/* Performs (in the presence of the "Makefile" file 
/* and the "clean" command in it) sequentially 
/* first cleaning the directory from .o files, 
/* then clears the terminal window, 
/* then builds the program (if there is a Makefile). 
/* The "c" argument only allows you to clean the terminal 
/* window ("mkm c"), and if you supply the name of 
/* an executable program as an argument, it starts 
/* its execution ("mkm name", where name is the 
/* name of the program).
